                <p>I have a very bad cat named Mitten. I got him from
                    a woman named Debby, who packed a bunch her own problems
                    into a cardboard box, dumped them onto the floor at work,
                    and made one of them mine. Even after all these years (14,
                    I think), I can't believe she gave me such a bad cat.</p>
                             
                <h2>The Early Years</h1>           
                <h3>Dude Looks Like a Lady</h3>
                    <p>The first and most irrational problem I have with
                        Mitten is that he was supposed to be a girl. I just prefer female pets.
                        Debby promised me he was a she. I even held up one of his calico
                         sisters and said, "I know this is a girl. All calicos are girls.
                        How come this one doesn't look the same?" But she swore, and I 
                        believed her, and I brought home Mitten, whom I planned on naming
                        Ruby. <em>Hmf!</em></p>
                                    
                <h3>That's How He Never Got His Name</h3>
                    <p>The vet explained to me that the "difference" I had seen was a descended
                        testicle and though he'd seen a lot of things in his career,
                        he'd never seen a female kitty with one of those. Ruby needed a name 
                        change.</p>
        
                    <p>Rudy/Rudolph seemed like an obvious choice. It was December
                        after all. It wasn't, and neither was Hugo. We had another cat named Kitty, so we couldn't fall back on that old copout, and for months just 
                        called him Kitten. I came home late from work to see him up to
                        something bad and cried, "Kitten McMitten." And the
                        last part stuck for some reason.</p>

                        <p>But it's a dumb name and I do feel a little guilty
                        wondering whether that dumb name contributed to  his badness. I mean, there
                        are countless articles on the influence of a name on business and
                        relationship success. Why not pet success? Did I doom
                        the poor guy? Did not giving him a real name make him feel
                        unloved? Are these questions signs that I should have had 
                        children?</p>
 
                <h3>Early Signs</h3>
                    <p>Honestly, though, I probably should have known by 
                        the way he fought the entire car ride home to be let
                        out of the box, poking his tiny white paw out of the top,
                        razor-sharp claws tearing at my hands as I tried to hold the flaps.
                        I probably should have known. </p>

                    <p>Or the way he&#8212on his first
                        night with us&#8212climbed down almost immediately from the cat
                        tree I'd placed him on for safety and hissed his way past the two dogs
                        (70 and 45&nbsppounds) and other cat that were his new
                        siblings. He had to get to the kitchen, which contained
                        his two favorite things, Mommy and food (order unknown).</p>
                        
                    <p>Or the way he, the very next morning, managed to bully a cheese-covered pill
                        from a 70-pound dog who lived for food and wind up in the hospital
                        for the first of what has gone on to be several necessary medical
                        iterventions for this little knucklehead. </p>
                
                <h2>The Mr. Pee-body Years</h2>
                    <p>Years of medical bills for a gaping wound on his side and 
                        an injured paw were nothing compared to when he got a 
                        urinary tract infection and began peeing on
                        whatever. My couch, my bed, workmen's dropcloths, nothing was spared.
                        He soaked the carpet in the dining room so badly that when we replaced the carpeting,
                        we also had to replace the baseboard and the lower 6 inches
                        of wall board. Long after the UTI was gone and he was on 
                        extremely expensive maintenance food to prevent a recurrence, 
                        he kept peeing, not always but often enough.</p>

                    <p>These were definitely the worst of times. There simply is 
                        only so much cat pee one can put up with. Yelling and intimidation made things worse. We wanted to give him away but couldn't. We talked
                        about having him put down but there was no way. We honestly just dealt with it until he (mostly) outgrew it.</p>
                        
                        <p>After all, he wasn't all bad. Who is? He once ran from five rooms away out the door to chase away
                        a cat that was threatening his sister, who had neither his size 
                        nor his moxie. He was and always has been my biggest cuddler. With 
                        all the pain I've felt when I absolutely knew I had to put a pet 
                        down, there was no way I coud do it for behavior reasons. So we 
                        loved and perservered and cleaned until he got over it (for the most part).
                    </p>
                    
                <h2>A Changed Cat</h2>

                <div><img src="images/sleepy_mitten.JPG" alt="Sleepy Mitten" width=375px></div>

                    <p>Today Mitten is Mr. Mellow, but he's still a pretty strange cat. We blame the 
                        dog's medicine for messing with his brain. If it storms in the middle of the 
                        night, you have to take him to the litter box or he may pee on the bed (thank 
                        goodness for waterproof matress pads). He likes to have his claws 
                        trimmed, even asks for it. He rarely grooms himself and hates to be 
                        brushed. He sometimes chews wood, including his favorite toy, the block of
                        wood shown in the photo.</p>

                    <p>All of Mitten's siblings are gone. He's the end of an era but seems to
                        enjoy his one-on-one time bouncing between laps. He was very close to 
                        his older sister, Kitty, later renamed Big Kitty. Her new name made sense when 
                        Mitten was little, and after he outweighed her by 10 pounds, it was ironic and 
                        matched her personality.</p>

                    <p>I have no real answer for why we kept Mitten through the many, many 
                        bad times, far too numerous to outline here. I guess because deep
                        down he is the Heathcliff in us all, the flawed tragic character
                        with just enough redeemable qualities to make you root for him. Also, 
                        life with him is just plain more interesting. Oh, and he's a 
                        hell of a mouser.</p>
